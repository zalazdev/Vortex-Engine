How to load the exmaples?

1) copy the example file to the engine executable path.
2) Drag the example (copied) file to the engine.

-- or --

1) Make a direct access of the engine's executable to the example file.
2) Drag the example file to the direct access of the engine's executable.


For make a new project:

1) Make a new project folder and put all the engine files to this directory ( yes, you need to copy keybind.txt too ) 
( the images, videos, sounds etc is for examples only, you don't need to copy them ) 
Only copy: 
   * The executable ( vortex_engine.exe ) 
   * The keybind.txt ( text archive ) 
   * All the provided dlls ( .dlls )
2) For launch with double click and not drag and drop the file to the engine you'll need to name the start file as (main.lua or main2.lua ) this file must be in the SAME folder as the engine. The others lua files can be in a sub-directory.

The root dir should see in this way.

Project_folder
--vortex_engine.exe
--*.dll ( means all engine's dll )
-- main.lua/main2.lua
